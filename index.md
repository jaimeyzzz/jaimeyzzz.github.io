## About Me
I am Jia-Ming Lu, a researcher in computer graphics. 
- Born in 1995, I received my Bachelor's degree in 2016 and Ph.D. in 2021 from Tsinghua University under the supervision of Professor Shi-Min Hu, focusing on physical animation and simulation techniques. 
- From 2021 to 2024, I served as the CFX Technical Lead and Cloth Simulation Topic Owner at the Anti-Entropy Research Team of miHoYo. In particular, my work was highly relevant to the digital human *Lumi* and the *Genshin Impact* game. 
- Currently, I am researching the integration of AI and computer graphics at ByteDance.

Iâ€™m deeply dedicated to unlocking the full potential of human creativity. What drives me is a profound passion for delving into the underlying, fundamental relationships between things.
